# hydrology computing examples
Simple hydrology computing and recipes in jupyter notebooks

This repository is used for a collection of resources for hydrology and water resources related lectures. 
At this moment the amount of notebooks is still quite small. When the amount increases, the notebooks will be organised in different subjects.

So far the following notebooks are contributed:
* steady_state_Q_h.ipynb - shows the kinematic wave simplifications of the De Saint-Venant equations and demonstrates how these can be used to assess channel conveyance capacity
* OPeNDAP_retrieval_analysis.ipynb - demonstrates how large datasets can be queried and analyzed through the xarray library
